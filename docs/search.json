    "text": "Imagine you’re standing in your kitchen with a helper robot. You want to teach it how to pick up a weirdly shaped mug. You don’t want to plug it into a supercomputer, wait for hours, or send its data to the cloud. You want it to learn right there, on the spot—fast, efficient, and offline.\nThat’s the dream. But with today’s AI infrastructure, it’s still far from reality."

    "text": "The Problem with Modern AI Training\nMost AI today is trained on massive data centers using powerful GPUs. This works great for large-scale models—but it completely breaks down for embodied intelligence, like robots.\nWhy?\n\nHigh energy consumption: A single GPU can consume 300W+. That’s more power than your fridge.\nSlow learning loops: Training even a small model can take hours or days.\nDependency on the cloud: Real-time response is impossible when your robot needs to “phone home” to think.\nBig form factors: Heavy compute modules don’t fit into lightweight, mobile robots.\n\nIf we want robots to truly live and learn in the real world, they need a new kind of brain."

    "text": "Optical Analog Neural Networks\nOptical analog neural networks are a radical shift in how we compute. Instead of using electricity and digital logic, they use light to do inference—and potentially even learning.\nHere’s how they work:\n\nLight as data: Inputs are encoded as light waves.\nOptics as weights: Layers of lenses or diffractive structures bend light to perform matrix multiplications.\nComputation is free: Inference happens as light passes through. No clock cycles. No energy cost beyond the laser."

Nature 588, 39–47 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2973-6\nGeneral Optical computing is not practical yet, but using optics for inference for visual computing applications is practical. This paper is a review on recent work on optical computing for AI.\nMotivation 1: Edge devices (cameras, cars, robots, headsets, IoT) need leaner (low latency, light, small, low power) computational imaging systems.\nOptical computing systems promise small form factor, massive parallelism, little to no power consumption. Optical interconnects are already widely used in data centers today.\nLinear optical elements can calculate convolution, fourier transforms, random projections, as a byproduct of light-matter interaction. These operations are what’s needed for DNNs.\n“Incorporating all-optical nonlinearities into photonic circuits is one of the key requirements for truly deep photonic networks. Yet, the challenge of efficiently implementing photonic nonlinear activation functions at low optical signal intensities was one of the primary reasons that interest in ONNs waned in the 1990s. Creative approaches from the last decade, such as nonlinear thresholders based on all-optical micro-ring resonators35, saturable absorbers29,36, electro-absorption modulators37, or hybrid electro-optical approaches38, represent possible solutions for overcoming this challenge in the near future.”\nAlthough programmability has traditionally been more difficult with photonic systems, first steps towards simplifying the process have recently been demonstrated\n“One direction that seems particularly well suited for optical and photonic processing is optical inference with incoherent light to rapidly process scene information under ambient lighting conditions. Such an approach presents many exciting opportunities for autonomous vehicles, robotics and computer vision, which we discuss next.”"
