    "text": "Imagine you’re standing in your kitchen with a helper robot. You want to teach it how to pick up a weirdly shaped mug. You don’t want to plug it into a supercomputer, wait for hours, or send its data to the cloud. You want it to learn right there, on the spot—fast, efficient, and offline.\nThat’s the dream. But with today’s AI infrastructure, it’s still far from reality."

    "section": "The Problem with Modern AI Training",
    "text": "The Problem with Modern AI Training\nMost AI today is trained on massive data centers using powerful GPUs. This works great for large-scale models—but it completely breaks down for embodied intelligence, like robots.\nWhy?\n\nHigh energy consumption: A single GPU can consume 300W+. That’s more power than your fridge.\nSlow learning loops: Training even a small model can take hours or days.\nDependency on the cloud: Real-time response is impossible when your robot needs to “phone home” to think.\nBig form factors: Heavy compute modules don’t fit into lightweight, mobile robots.\n\nIf we want robots to truly live and learn in the real world, they need a new kind of brain."

    "text": "Optical Analog Neural Networks\nOptical analog neural networks are a radical shift in how we compute. Instead of using electricity and digital logic, they use light to do inference—and potentially even learning.\nHere’s how they work:\n\nLight as data: Inputs are encoded as light waves.\nOptics as weights: Layers of lenses or diffractive structures bend light to perform matrix multiplications.\nComputation is free: Inference happens as light passes through. No clock cycles. No energy cost beyond the laser."

    "text": "Why This Matters for Robots\nWith optical neural networks, we could give robots something revolutionary:\n\nLearn on the Spot Training and inference could happen in-situ, without ever leaving the robot. If you show it a new tool or task, it could adapt in real time.\nTiny and Lightweight Optical layers can be embedded directly into sensors—no bulky GPUs needed.\nUltra-Low Power Since light travels through passive structures, inference consumes almost zero energy.\nNo Cloud Dependency On-device learning means no latency, no data privacy risks, and no need for connectivity."
