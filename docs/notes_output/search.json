Nature 588, 39–47 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2973-6\nGeneral Optical computing is not practical yet, but using optics for inference for visual computing applications is practical. This paper is a review on recent work on optical computing for AI.\nMotivation 1: Edge devices (cameras, cars, robots, headsets, IoT) need leaner (low latency, light, small, low power) computational imaging systems.\nOptical computing systems promise small form factor, massive parallelism, little to no power consumption. Optical interconnects are already widely used in data centers today.\nLinear optical elements can calculate convolution, fourier transforms, random projections, as a byproduct of light-matter interaction. These operations are what’s needed for DNNs.\n“Incorporating all-optical nonlinearities into photonic circuits is one of the key requirements for truly deep photonic networks. Yet, the challenge of efficiently implementing photonic nonlinear activation functions at low optical signal intensities was one of the primary reasons that interest in ONNs waned in the 1990s. Creative approaches from the last decade, such as nonlinear thresholders based on all-optical micro-ring resonators35, saturable absorbers29,36, electro-absorption modulators37, or hybrid electro-optical approaches38, represent possible solutions for overcoming this challenge in the near future.”\nAlthough programmability has traditionally been more difficult with photonic systems, first steps towards simplifying the process have recently been demonstrated\n“One direction that seems particularly well suited for optical and photonic processing is optical inference with incoherent light to rapidly process scene information under ambient lighting conditions. Such an approach presents many exciting opportunities for autonomous vehicles, robotics and computer vision, which we discuss next.”",

The flux of that field passing through any closed surface is proportional to the total charge contained within that surface.\n\\[\\oint_S \\vec{E} \\cdot \\hat{n} da = \\frac{q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn About Left Hand Side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the left hand side represent?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe number of electric field lines (AKA electric flux) passing through a closed surface \\(S\\).\n\n\nWhat is Electric field?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe electrical force exerted on one coulomb of charge at that point in space is the electric field at that location.\n\\[\\vec{E} = \\frac{\\vec{F}_e}{q_0}\\]\n\\(\\vec{E}\\) has units of \\(\\frac{N}{C} = \\frac{V}{m}\\)\nSpacing of electric field lines tells you the strength of it.\n\nElectric field lines go from positive to negative\nElectric field lines vector sums, so they never cross\n\n\n\nWhy do physicists and engineers always talk about small test charges?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nBecause the job of this charge is to test the electric field at a location, not to add another electric field into the mix (although you can’t stop it from doing so). Making the test charge infinitesimally small minimizes the effect of the test charge’s own field.\n\n\nWhat is the dot product? Why are we taking the dot product between \\(\\vec{E}\\) and \\(\\hat{n}\\) in Gauss’s Law?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nConsider vectors \\(\\vec{A}\\) and \\(\\vec{B}\\) in space.\nWhat is the projection of \\(\\vec{A}\\) onto \\(\\vec{B}\\)? From trig, it’s \\(|A| \\cos \\theta\\).\nNow the dot product is that projection, multiplied by the magnitude of \\(\\vec{B}\\).\n\\[\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = |A| |B| \\cos \\theta\\]\n\n\nWhat is \\(\\hat{n}\\)?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIt is the unit normal vector, which has a length of one, and points in the direction perpendicular to the surface.\nNote that since \\(da\\) is the tiny amount of area we are considering\n\\[\\hat{n} da = d \\vec{a}\\]\n\n\nWhat is the difference between closed surface and open surface?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\nOpen Surface - any surface for which it is possible to get from one side to the other without going through the surface\nClosed Surface - a surface that divides space into an “inside” and “outside”. Unit Normal Vector \\(\\hat{n}\\) always points outwards, away from the volume enclosed by the surface.\n\n\n\nWhat does \\(\\vec{E} \\cdot \\hat{n}\\) represent?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe component of the electric field vector that is perpendicular to the surface.\n\\[\\vec{E} \\cdot \\hat{n} = |\\vec{E}| \\cos \\theta\\]\n\n\nHow do you find the mass of a surface with varying density function \\(\\sigma(x, y)\\)?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nSince mass is density times volume, we can write:\n\\[Mass = \\sigma \\cdot Area\\]\n\\[Mass_S = \\Sigma_{i = 1}^{N} \\sigma_i \\cdot Area_i\\]\nIf we let Areas to become infinitesimally small \\(dA\\), we get \\[Mass = \\int_{S} \\sigma dA\\]\nThis is a surface intergal.\n\n\nWhat does \\(\\int_S \\vec{A} \\cdot \\hat{n} da\\) represent?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIt represents the flux of a vector field.\nWhat’s a vector field?\nIt is magnitude and direction quantities distributed in space.\n\nScalar Field - something like temperature distribution in a room, where at each point theres a number\nVector Field - something like flow of fluid, there at every point it has a speed and direction\n\n\n\nWhat’s flux \\(\\Phi\\)?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nFlux \\(\\Phi\\) of a field over a surface is the amount of flow through that surface.\n\\[\\Phi = \\vec{A} \\cdot \\hat{n} \\times (Surface Area)\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn About Right Hand Side\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the right hand side in words?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe total amount of enclosed charge normalized by the permittivity of free space.\n\n\nWhat is \\(\\epsilon_0\\) and why is it there?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIt is called the permitivity of free space or “vacuum permitivity”.\n\\[\\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\frac{F}{m}\\]\nWhen we say the permitivity of a material, when are referring to its reponse to an electric field. It is also the key parameter in determining the speed at which an electromagnetic wave propagates through that medium.\nHigh permitivity means it provides higher capacitance.\nIn Gauss’s Law, \\(\\epsilon_0\\) acts as a proportionality constant that relates electric flux to enclosed charge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive point charges are enclosed in a cylindrical surface \\(S\\). If the values of the charges are \\(q_1 = +3 nC\\), \\(q_2 = -2 nC\\), \\(q_3 = +2 nC\\), \\(q_4 = +4 nC\\), and \\(q_5 = -1 nC\\), find the total flux through \\(S\\).\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^{5} q_i = 3 - 2 + 2 + 4 - 1 = 6 nC = 6 \\times 10^{-9} C\\]\n\\[\\Phi_E = \\frac{q_enc}{\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{6 \\times 10^{-9}C}{8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\frac{C}{V \\cdot m}} = \\boxed{678 \\hspace{1mm} Vm}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferential Form of Gauss’s Law\n\n\n\nExpand\n\nThe electric field produced by electric diverges from positive charge and converges upon negative charge.\n\\[\\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn About Left Hand Side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the left hand side represent?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\nThe tendency of electric field to flow away from a point in space - AKA the divergence.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between differential and integral form of Gauss’s Law?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\nDifferential deals with individual points in space, whereareas integral deals with a closed surface.\n\n\nWhat is \\(\\vec{\\nabla}\\)?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\nIt is called “del” or “nabla”. It tells you to take the derivative of what ever quantity comes after it.\n\\[\\vec{\\nabla} =\\hat{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\hat{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\hat{k} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\n\\]\nIt is an mathematical operator, which just means that it needs something to act on and cannot just appear by itself.\n\\(\\vec{\\nabla}\\) is gradient, \\(\\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot\\) is divergence, and \\(\\vec{\\nabla} \\times\\) is curl.\n\n\nWhat is \\(\\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot\\) specifically?\n\n\n\nExpand\n\nOliver Heaviside suggested the word “divergence” to describe the rate at which electric field flow outwards from a positive charge.\n\nsource - diverge from that point (positive charge for electric field)\nsink - converge to that point (negative charge for magnetic field)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn About Right Hand Side\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the right hand side in words?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive point charges are enclosed in a cylindrical surface \\(S\\).
