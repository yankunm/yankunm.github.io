What is the flux through any closed surface surrounding a charged sphere of radius \\(a_0\\) with volume charge density of \\(ρ = ρ_0(r/a_0)\\), where \\(r\\) is the distance from the center of the sphere?\n5. A circular disk with surface charge density \\(2 \\times 10^{-10}\\) C/m² is surrounded by a sphere with radius of one meter.
