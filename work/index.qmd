# Preface {.unnumbered}

If you are reading this, you may be interesed in seeing what is "Alex's Notes". 

These notes are just things that I am documenting, that I wish could become a useful resource for my future students, either when I TA or become a professor.

Here's how to learn anything:

1. Write it out! (Document, Code along)
2. EXPERIMENT and explore
3. Visualize things you don't understand
4. Ask Questions
5. Answer Exercise and Problems (stretch your knowledge)
6. Share with like-minded individuals
