- What does the differential form of maxwell's equations do?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Assume field vectors are single-valued, bounded, continuous functions, with inputs of position and time, and exhibit continuous derivatives.

It is used to describe and relate field vectors, current densities, and charge densities at any point in space at any time.
</details>

- Where does discontinuous distributions of charges and currents occur?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
At interfaces between media where there are discrete changes in electrical parameters across the interface.

- What are the four maxwell's equation in differential form?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
$$\nabla \times \vec{E} = $$
$$\nabla \times \vec{H} = $$

$$\nabla \cdot \vec{D} = $$

$$\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = $$
