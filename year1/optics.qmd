# Ray Optics

## Introduction

Picturing light as rays is useful for predicting imaging properties. 

As $\lambda \rightarrow 0$, Maxwell equation's become the [eikonal equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eikonal_equation), which governs ray direction in a medium with a varying $n(\vec{r})$.

[Fermat's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_principle) is deduced from eikonal equation.

[Snell's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law) is derived from fermat's principle.


## Eikonal Equation

$$\nabla^2 \vec{E}(\vec{r}, t) + \frac{[n(\vec{r})]^2 \omega^2}{c^2} \vec{E}(\vec{r}, t) = 0 \tag{wave equation in isotropic medium}$$
$$\vec{E}(\vec{r}, t) = \vec{E}_0 e^{i[k_{vac} R(\vec{r}) - \omega t]}, k_{vac} = \frac{\omega}{c} \left( \frac{rad}{m} \right) \tag{trial solution}$$

We plug trial solution in, perform laplacian, arrange terms, and make the approximation that $\frac{1}{k_{vac}} = \frac{\lambda_{vac}}{2 \pi} \rightarrow 0$, we get

$$[\nabla R(\vec{r}) \cdot \nabla R(\vec{r}) - [n(\vec{r})]^2] \vec{E}_0(\vec{r}) = 0 \tag{Simplified wave equation}$$

$$\implies \nabla R(\vec{r}) \cdot \nabla R(\vec{r}) = [n(\vec{r})]^2$$

$$\implies \boxed{ \nabla R(\vec{r}) = n(\vec{r}) \hat{s}(\vec{r}) } \tag{eikonal function}$$

If $R(\vec{r})$ (length) is real, no absorption or amplification. $R(\vec{r}) = constant$ is one wavefront. $\nabla R(\vec{r})$ is the local direction of propagation. $\hat{s}$ is unit vector in direction of energy flow. **Rays** are collection vectors $\hat{s}$.

## Fermat's Principle

$$\nabla \times [\nabla R(\vec{r})] = \nabla \times [n(\vec{r}) \hat{s}(\vec{r})] = 0  \tag{curl of eikonal function}$$

$$\int_{A} \nabla \times [n(\vec{r}) \hat{s}(\vec{r})] = 0  \tag{integrate over open surface A}$$

$$\oint_{C} n \hat{s} \cdot d\vec{l} = 0 \tag{By Stoke's Theorem}$$

$$\implies \int_{A}^{B} n \hat{s} \cdot d\vec{l} \text{is independent of path}$$

Notice that

$$\int_{A}^{B} n \hat{s} \cdot d\vec{l} = \min{\int_{A}^{B} n d \vec{l}}$$

We define **Optical Path Length** as

$$\boxed{OPL = \frac{A}{B} n dl}$$

And **Fermat's Theorem** minimizes

$$\delta t = \frac{OPL}{c} \tag{travel time}$$








## Paraxial Ray Theory

Propagation of rays through optical systems can be approximated as *paraxial*, nearly parallel to the axis of these systems.

[Paraxial ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraxial_approximation) theory predicts stability of laser cavities, to see if ray drift away from optical axis.
