## About Me

I am an incoming PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University, fortunate to be advised by Prof. Natalia M. Litchinitser. Previously, I was an undergrad at Duke University Double majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science.

## Research Interests

* **Computational Optics**: Leveraging machine learning, optics, metamaterials, and computer engineering to design next-generation graphics, imaging, and vision systems.
 
* **Optical Computing**: Exploring the use of light for data processing and communication to enable faster, more energy-efficient computing architectures.
